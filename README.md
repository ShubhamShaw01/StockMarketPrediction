# Stock Market Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict stock market trends using machine learning techniques. It involves data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to generate accurate predictions of stock prices or trends.

## Features
- Data collection from stock market sources (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, etc.)
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, normalization, feature selection)
- Feature engineering (technical indicators, sentiment analysis, etc.)
- Model training using various machine learning algorithms
- Model evaluation and performance analysis
- Visualization of stock trends and predictions

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Source**: Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or other financial APIs
- **Model Types**: Linear Regression, LSTM, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShubhamShaw01/StockMarketPrediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd stock-market-prediction
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the data collection script:
   ```bash
   python data_collection.py
   ```
2. Preprocess the data:
   ```bash
   python preprocess_data.py
   ```
3. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
4. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```
5. Make predictions:
   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```

## Results and Evaluation
- Model performance is evaluated using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.
- Visualization of actual vs. predicted prices.
- Comparative analysis of different ML models.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporation of deep learning models (LSTMs, transformers)
- Real-time stock prediction
- Sentiment analysis of news headlines affecting stocks
